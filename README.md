## CYBER LAWS OF BANGLADESH
<!-- ## Existing Cyber Laws of Bangladesh -->
<!--# **Existing Cyber Laws of Bangladesh**-->

### **ICT Act, 2006**  
- This was Bangladesh’s first law to deal with cybercrime like hacking, spreading false information, and online fraud.  

- One part called Section 57 was often misused by authorities to arrest people for sharing opinions or criticizing others online, even if they didn’t do anything wrong.  

- Because of these problems, the law became less popular and was replaced by newer laws.  

---

### **Digital Security Act, 2018**  
This law replaced many parts of the ICT Act and focused on fighting fake news, cyber terrorism, online harassment, and other digital crimes.  

However, many people criticized this law because it sometimes stopped people from speaking freely online.  

Due to these issues, the government repealed (cancelled) this law in 2023 and introduced a new one.  

---

### **Cyber Security Act, 2023**  
This is the law that replaced the Digital Security Act. It tries to make punishments less harsh and be more balanced.  

But it still has vague terms, meaning some parts are not very clear.  

Also, it does not have strong rules to protect people’s personal information online.  

---

### **Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025 (Latest)**  
- This newest law says that access to the internet is a basic right for every citizen.  

- It bans certain activities like online gambling and crimes involving artificial intelligence (AI).  

- The law removes some unfair or misused sections from older laws to protect people better.  

However, it still does not have strong protection for personal data, which is a big concern.  

---

### **Data Protection Laws (Under Development)**  
- Bangladesh knows it needs better laws to protect personal data online.  

- Right now, new data protection laws are being drafted but are not yet official.  

---

### **Other Important Laws Related to Cybersecurity**  
- **Telecommunications Act, 2001:** Controls phone and internet companies to make sure they follow rules.  
- **Electronic Transaction Act, 2006:** Covers things like electronic signatures and safe online transactions.  

Various government rules also support cybersecurity and safe use of technology.
