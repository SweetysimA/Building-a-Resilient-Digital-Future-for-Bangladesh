<p align="justify">
As the world becomes more digital, keeping people safe and secure online is vital for a country’s well-being. Bangladesh is rapidly embracing digital technology, with more people and businesses relying on the internet for communication, commerce, and public services. However, these advancements also bring growing threats such as cybercrime, data breaches, and online fraud.

## EXISTING CYBER LAWS OF BANGLADESH

<p align="justify">
Bangladesh’s existing cyber laws include the <strong> ICT Act (2006)</strong>, the <strong>Digital Security Act (2018)</strong>, and the <strong>Cyber Security Act (2023)</strong>, with the most recent update being the <strong>Cyber Security Ordinance (2025)</strong>.
These laws aim to address issues like cybercrime, online harassment, and digital misinformation.
</p>

### **ICT Act, 2006**  

<p align="justify">
This was the first law in Bangladesh focused on cybercrimes like hacking, spreading false information, and online fraud. However, Section 57 of this law was often misused to arrest people for expressing their opinions online. Due to heavy criticism, this law was largely replaced by newer ones.
</p>


### **Digital Security Act, 2018** 

<p align="justify">
This law replaced many parts of the ICT Act. It aimed to tackle fake news, cyber terrorism, and online harassment. However, it was criticized for limiting freedom of speech. Because of its misuse, the government repealed this law in 2023.
</p>



### **Cyber Security Act, 2023**  

<p align="justify">
This act replaced the Digital Security Act. It tried to reduce punishments and be more balanced. However, many terms in the law are vague, and it still does not strongly protect personal data.  
</p>



### **Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025 (Latest)**  

<p align="justify">
This is the most recent law. It recognizes access to the internet as a basic right and bans activities like online gambling and AI-related cybercrimes. It also removes some misused parts of older laws. However, it still lacks strong data protection policies.
</p>



###  **Data Protection Laws (Under Development)**

<p align="justify">
Bangladesh is in the process of introducing a comprehensive <strong>Data Protection Law </strong> to safeguard citizens’ personal information in the digital space. The proposed law aims to establish clear rules for how data is collected, used, and shared by organizations and service providers.

### Features of this Draft Law

- **Informed Consent**  
  Organizations must clearly explain why they are collecting personal data and obtain consent from users before doing so.

- **Data Subject Rights**  
  Individuals will have the right to access, correct, or delete their personal data. The law also introduces the **“right to be forgotten,”** allowing individuals to request data deletion when it is no longer needed.

- **Data Minimization**  
  Only essential data should be collected, avoiding unnecessary or excessive information gathering.

- **Cross-Border Restrictions**  
  The draft law aims to limit the transfer of personal data to foreign servers unless proper protections are in place.

- **Regulatory Oversight**  
  A **Data Protection Authority (DPA)** is expected to be formed to monitor compliance, investigate complaints, and enforce penalties for misuse of data.

<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bangladesh is currently working on new data protection laws to ensure people’s personal information is safe online. These laws are still in the drafting stage and not yet official.
</p>

</p>




### **Other Important Laws Related to Cybersecurity**  
- **Telecommunications Act, 2001:** Regulates phone and internet service providers to ensure compliance with national standards. 
- **Electronic Transaction Act, 2006:** Covers the use of electronic signatures and ensures the legality of online transactions.  

- Various government rules also support cybersecurity and safe use of technology.

<br>


<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these laws cover many cybercrimes, they still fall short in key areas such as protecting personal data, ensuring digital rights, and clearly defining offenses. Most laws lack strong data privacy measures, use vague language open to misuse, and do not adequately regulate emerging technologies like AI. These gaps highlight the need for more balanced, transparent, and forward-looking legal reforms.
